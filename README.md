# Ping Pong

A fun and learning project to understand how graphics pipeline work and how engines work.
Goal of this project is experiment and make game with LWJGL using OpenGL and GLFW.
Will later extract the engine and grow it as it goes and is needed.
This is very basic compared to others but was still hella complex for me but working on it is fun
though XD.

### Architecture

Currently, it has separated core entities.
No ECS yet but some assets are managed by AssetManager.
Uses Layer architecture to manage different game states, like Menu, Pause and Game.
